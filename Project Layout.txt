You are a student trying to organize your subjects and grades using python. 
Let's explore whate we've learned about lists to organize your subjects and 
scores.

1. Create a list called subjects: 
    - physics
    - calculus
    - poetry
    - history

2. Create a list called grades and fill it with your scores:
    - 98
    - 97
    - 85
    - 88

3. Use the zip() function to combine subjects and grades. Save this zip object 
   as a list into a variable called gradebook.

4. Print gradebook.

5. Your grade for Computer Science class just came in! 
   You got a perfect score, 100!
   After your definitions of subjects and grades but before you create gradebook, 
   use append to add "computer science" to subjects and 100 to grades.

6. Your grade for visual arts just came in! You got a 93!
   After the creation of gradebook (but before you print is out), use append
   to add ("visual arts",93) to gradebook.

7. You also have your grades from last semeter stored in last_semester_gradebook. 
   Create a new variable full_gradebook with the items from both gradebook and 
   last_semester_gradebook.
